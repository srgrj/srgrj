# 🚀 Senior Python Backend Developer | API & Microservices | AWS | PostgreSQL | Cloud-Native Architectures

With over 10 years of experience in backend engineering, I specialize in designing and building scalable, high-performance, and event-driven architectures for cloud-native applications. My expertise spans across Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS, focusing on API development, microservices, and serverless systems.

As a technical leader and mentor, I thrive in guiding engineering teams, conducting code reviews, and driving best practices in scalability, performance optimization, and security. My passion for continuous learning has led me to explore DevOps, CI/CD, infrastructure as code (Terraform), and data engineering with Apache Airflow.

## 🔹 What I Do Best
- ✅ Architect and develop API-driven, event-driven, and microservices-based applications
- ✅ Optimize system performance by reducing response times and ensuring high availability
- ✅ Design and implement scalable, secure cloud solutions using AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB, EventBridge, EKS)
- ✅ Mentor engineers, lead code reviews, and enforce best practices in software design and cloud security
- ✅ Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- ✅ Build data pipelines, ETL workflows, and automation solutions with Apache Airflow
